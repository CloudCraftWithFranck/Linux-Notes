Basic commands to know while starting linux OS.
Remember that linux is based on command lines, and its an open source. Open Source means you can modify it to use the way you want. There are some commands to remember.
Once you login to use command line, you will see a $ sign which means you are running as a user; therefore, you cannot modilfy anything or run any command. To run any command you need to switch from user to super user(called admin in windows). The command use for the purpose will be "sudo". The next step will be to enter your username and passport to confirm you are the owner. Once its done, you can now run anything you want. Here is an example:
